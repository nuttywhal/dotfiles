[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for macOS. The `install.sh` script installs Homebrew and all of the packages listed in the Brewfile. The `path.zsh` adds the GNU Coreutils binaries to `$PATH` so that the normal command names can be used (i.e. `ls` instead of `gls`). This allows for cross-compatibility with Arch Linux when loading command aliases in `zsh/aliases.zsh`.
