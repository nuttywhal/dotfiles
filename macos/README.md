The `install.sh` script automatically configures some macOS settings:

- Dock configuration (`autohide` = true, `tilesize` = 48, `largesize` = 64).
- Enable dark mode for the Dock and menu bar.
- Keyboard settings (DAS = 15, ARR = 1) — I like Tetris. 凸
- Disable mouse acceleration. Gross.

I use a Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum mouse. I use [Smooze](https://smooze.co) to configure my mouse settings since macOS lacks native support for it. It allows me to reverse the scrolling direction, map the back and forward buttons to actions, and enable smooth scrolling.

These are my global settings:

- Vertical Lines (number of lines to move on each tick): `2.00`
- Horizontal Lines (number of lines to move on each tick): `2.00`
- Reverse Vertical Direction (scrolling down moves page down): `true`
- Animate Scroll (scrolling animation style): `CubicOut`
- Animation Duration (smoothness of scrolling experience): `800`

These are my application-specific settings for Visual Studio Code:

- Vertical Lines (number of lines to move on each tick): `1.00`
- Horizontal Lines (number of lines to move on each tick): `1.00`
- Reverse Vertical Direction (scrolling down moves page down): `true`
- Animate Scroll (scrolling animation style): `Linear`
- Animation Duration (smoothness of scrolling experience): `100`
